- please file bug reports, patches and feature requests here if
possible (otherwise, feel free to use the mailing list)
- significant contributions require a copyright assignment to the
Eudaemonia Inc. The maintainer will be happy to answer questions
about the process.

Mailing list: bug-org-babel-tangle@eudaemonia.org
- please use this list for all discussion

Bug reports:
Please include enough information for the maintainers to reproduce the
problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
- the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug
and command line invocations of the program(s) involved (crucial!).
- a description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- the version number of the program(s) involved (use --version).
- hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (uname -a).
- unusual options you gave to configure, if any (see config.status).
- anything else that you think would be helpful.

Patching process:
- All changes must be sent to mailing list.
- Changes are reviewed by maintainers.
- Maintainer does not review own changes.
* In case of single maintainer, or unresponsive co-maintainer, mailing
list subscribers may perform the review.
- Review means either a patch approval, comments to author, or a reject.
* Approved patches are taken to upstream git.
* Commented patches will require work before they can be approved.
Comments can be untechnical, such as a change author must submit a
copyright assignment to Eudaemonia Inc.
* Authors are encouraged to discontinue work with rejected changes, as
the reject is permanent.
- Maintainers keep track of rejected changes so that developers can avoid
proposing the same in future.

Patches are most welcome; if possible, please make them in git-am
format, and include a suitable commit message.

See README-dev.md for information on the development environment --
any interested parties are welcome.  If you're a programmer and wish
to contribute, this should get you started.  If you're not a
programmer, your help in writing test cases, checking the
documentation against the implementation, translating the program
strings to other languages, etc., would still be very much
appreciated.
